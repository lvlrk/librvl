i started making this project because i wanted<br>
to implement an easy-to-use and straight-forward<br>
library for manipulation of Wii game and Wii Standard<br>
file formats. i am currently desigining this library<br>
to follow the same design standards as raylib.<br>
as the current version (v0) is in development,<br>
i will work hard to make this library the best it can be.<br>
